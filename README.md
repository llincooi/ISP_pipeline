# Introduction

# Objectives

This project aims to provide an overview of ISP and stimulate the whole ISP pipeline and some tuning functions from hardware perspectives by python. The proposed ISP pipeline consists of following modules, dead pixel correction (DPC), black level compensation (BLC), lens shading correction (LSC), anti-aliasing noise filter (ANF), auto white balance gain control (AWB), color filter array interpolation (CFA), gamma correction (GC), color correction matrix (CCM), color space conversion (CSC), noise reduction for luma and chroma (NR), edge enhancement (EE), hue/saturation/control (HSC) and brightness/contast control (BCC).
